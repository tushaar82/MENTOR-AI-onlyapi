"""
Verification Router Module

This module defines FastAPI endpoints for email and phone verification
in the Mentor AI EdTech Platform. It exposes four verification endpoints
for sending and confirming email/phone verification codes.

Endpoints:
- POST /verify/email/send: Send email verification code
- POST /verify/email/confirm: Confirm email with verification code
- POST /verify/phone/send: Send phone OTP
- POST /verify/phone/confirm: Confirm phone with OTP

    Send a verification code to the parent's email address.
    
    This endpoint generates a 6-character alphanumeric verification code
    and sends it to the specified email address. The code is valid for
    10 minutes and can be used to verify email ownership.
    
    **Requirements:**
    - Email must be a valid email address
    - Email should be associated with a registered parent account
    
    **Returns:**
    - 200: Verification code sent successfully
    - 400: Invalid email format or validation error
    - 500: Internal server error
    
    **Note:** In production, the verification code is sent via email.
    In development, it's returned in the response for testing purposes.
